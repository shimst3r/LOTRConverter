# LOTRConverter

LOTRConverter is the first project in the ["iOS 18, SwiftUI 6, & Swift 6: Build iOS Apps From Scratch"](iOS 18, SwiftUI 6, & Swift 6: Build iOS Apps From Scratch) course by Kenneth Jones.

Its premise is to introduce various SwiftUI features, like

- How to create an app, how to properly use the `#Preview` macro, etc.
- `ZStack`, `VStack`, `HStack`, `LazyVGrid` for laying out your views.
- `@Binding`, `@FocusState`, `@State` for managing various types of properties.

In addition I added a test suite using Swift Testing after watching the [Go further with Swift Testing](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10195) video from WWDC24. Software testing is important and Swift Testing is a nice framework!

This is my first SwiftUI / iOS app ever, so it has a lot of rough edges. ðŸ¥²
