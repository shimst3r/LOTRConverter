# LOTRConverter

LOTRConverter is the first project in the [iOS 18, SwiftUI 6, & Swift 6: Build iOS Apps From Scratch](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-15-app-development-with-swiftui-3-and-swift-5/) course by Kenneth Jones.

The app converts between various fictional currencies related to The Lord of the Rings. Although the core functionality is small, it sparked my interest in SwiftUI and iOS development. I can't wait to work on bigger projects with actual value. ðŸ˜„

Its premise is to introduce various SwiftUI features, like

- How to create an app, how to properly use the `#Preview` macro, etc.
- `ZStack`, `VStack`, `HStack`, `LazyVGrid` for laying out your views.
- `@Binding`, `@FocusState`, `@State` for managing various types of properties.

In addition I added a test suite using Swift Testing after watching the [Go further with Swift Testing](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10195) video from WWDC24. Software testing is important and Swift Testing is a nice framework!

This is my first SwiftUI / iOS app ever, so it has a lot of rough edges. ðŸ¥²
